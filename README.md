This project is designed to demonstrate and consolidate
knowledge about basic structure of an HTML file.
It is a simple recipe website built with using only HTML.

Revision:
I learned how to create a basic HTML page.
An HTML file must include !DOCTYPE html, the html tag, and inside it, the head and body tags.

The head section contains information about the page that is not displayed in the browser.
The body section contains the content that is displayed in the browser.

Common HTML Tags I Learned:
h1-h6 - used to create headings (from largest to smallest)

p - used to create paragraphs

ul - creates an unordered (bulleted) list

ol - creates an ordered (numbered) list

li - defines a list item (used inside ul or ol)

img - displays an image (must include the attribute src and path to image)

a - used to create link to other page (must include the attribute href and path)
